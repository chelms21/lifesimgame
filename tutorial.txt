Mii Town Simulator - Player's Guide
======================================

Welcome to Mii Town on Maple Island! Your role is the Caretaker, managing the lives, finances, and infrastructure of your Mii residents.

--------------------------------------
I. STARTING THE GAME
--------------------------------------
1. Create Your First Mii: Give your Mii a name, gender, and personality.
2. Choose Mode & Difficulty:
   - Manual ✋: You must manage everything (feeding, finding jobs, relationships).
   - Automatic 🤖: Miis will attempt to act autonomously (work, date), but still need help.
   - Easy 😎: Starts with extra money and the Caretaker unlocked.
3. Start Town Life: Once you have at least one Mii, click to begin the simulation.

--------------------------------------
II. CORE MII STATS
--------------------------------------
The well-being of your Miis is essential. Stats decay over time.

- ❤️ Happiness (0-100): Decreases when hungry, homeless, or rejected. Increases with activities, relationships, and items. If it hits 0, the Mii passes away.
- 🍔 Hunger (0-100): Decreases constantly. Increases by using 'food' items from the Inventory.
- Status: Watch the Mii's message box and avatar for visual cues (sad, starving, sleeping).
- Sleep 🛌: Use the 'Go to Sleep' button when a Mii is low on happiness but not hungry. Sleeping Miis regenerate happiness faster and have slower hunger decay.

--------------------------------------
III. TOWN INFRASTRUCTURE (Build Town 🏗️)
--------------------------------------
Use the "Build Town" button to expand your town.

A. HOUSING (Apartments)
   - Status: Check the "Housing" stat on the Mii card. Miis with "⚠️ Homeless" suffer a significant happiness decay penalty.
   - Houses: Each House/Apartment costs 💰300 and can hold a maximum of 2 residents. Build more to house all your residents and partners!

B. FACILITIES
   - Park 🌳 (Cost: 💰500): Provides a small, permanent happiness decay bonus for all residents.
   - Restaurant 🍽️ (Cost: 💰1000): Increases the quality/effectiveness of all food items used by Miis.

--------------------------------------
IV. TOWN ACTIONS
--------------------------------------
- Work 💼: The selected Mii works for money. Pay is based on their Job and modified by their current Happiness/Hunger.
- Throw Party 🎉 (Cost: 💰150): Gives a large happiness boost to ALL active Miis.
- Build Town 🏗️: Manage and build new houses and town facilities (see III.)

--------------------------------------
V. JOBS & CAREER (Click the Job Stat)
--------------------------------------
- Job Icon 💻: Click the Job status on the Mii card to open the Job Modal and assign a new career.
- Base Pay: Every job (except Unemployed) earns gold per hour worked.

VI. RELATIONSHIPS (❤️ Interact / Date)

--------------------------------------
VII. FINANCIAL SYSTEMS
--------------------------------------
